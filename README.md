## Dashboard

### Visitors per Day
This section contains a line chart component that visualizes the number of visitors per day. It allows users to click on a specific date to zoom in on data from that date and the surrounding five days. A reset button enables users to return to the full dataset, making it easy to analyze visitor trends over time.

### Visitors per Country
This section displays a bar chart that shows the number of visitors from different countries. It provides a visual representation of where visitors are coming from, helping to identify geographic trends in hotel bookings. The chart is interactive, allowing users to hover over bars for additional information.

### Adult Visitor and Children Visitor
This part features an area chart that presents statistics on adult and child visitors. It allows for similar zooming functionality as the visitors per day chart. The total number of visitors (both adults and children) is prominently displayed above the chart for quick reference, giving an at-a-glance overview of visitor demographics.

### Testcase for API Service
This section includes a set of automated tests for the API service function that fetches hotel bookings data. It verifies that the function correctly fetches and parses CSV data from a specified URL. The tests check for successful data retrieval, proper handling of network errors, and ensure that invalid CSV data is appropriately handled. Mocks are used to simulate fetch requests and responses during testing, ensuring that the functionality is validated without relying on an actual API.
